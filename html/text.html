				<strong>Standard Paragraph </strong> One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.

				Every business big or small needs a website, and in this economy a small
				to medium sized business especially needs to shine. The website of a
				business competing with the big stores or chains must convey quality and
				be every bit as sophisticated as the big dudes but still show their
				personality and niche.

			<h4>Heading Four</h4>

				Your task is to create a fictional client in the category of small to
				medium sized business. The business can be retail, service, health,
				etc., but they will need to have a niche, specialty, or something
				special. They can have a physical location, or sell only on-line.We all
				have folks we know who need a website, more often than not I'll say it's
				best to create your own fictional client, so the decisions and goals
				remain intact and yours. Once your client is defined you must creatively
				promote the benefits of your client's products or services and create a
				web presence that informs, engages as well as communicates specifically
				to their target market.

				One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed.
